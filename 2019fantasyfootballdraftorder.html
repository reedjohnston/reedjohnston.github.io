<h1>2019 Fantasy Football Draft Order Selection</h1>
<br>                                                                               
We'll be using the Little League World Series (LLWS) to determine our draft order this year. 
<br>
<br>                                                                              
The tournament runs from August 15th-25th. It includes 16 teams; 8 teams representing the champions from the regional tournaments in the Unites States and 8 teams representing the International country/region champions.
<br>
<br>                                                                               
We'll be drawing our names from a hat and assigning them to LLWS teams drawn from another hat. After all ten names are drawn and assigned to a LLWS team we will simply ignore the remaining 6 LLWS teams in the hat.
Top seed for the draft will go to the person assigned to the LLWS team that finishes with the highest placing in the tournament.
